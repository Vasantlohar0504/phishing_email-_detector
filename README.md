# 🛡️ Phishing Email Detection System

A **Machine Learning–based web application** that detects whether an email is **Phishing** or **Legitimate**. The system analyzes email content, URLs, and attachments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning models, helping users identify phishing attacks in real time.
---

## 📊 Project Overview
The Phishing Email Detection System demonstrates how AI can improve email security. Users can analyze suspicious links, check attachments, and receive predictions about emails to reduce the risk of phishing attacks.
---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Backend programming & ML model development  
- **Flask** – Web application framework  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model creation  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing & manipulation  
- **SQLite** – Database management for logs and users  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend interface  
- **NLP Techniques** – Email text preprocessing & feature extraction  

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains emails labeled as **Phishing** or **Legitimate**, including:  
- **Email Content** (text)  
- **URLs** contained in emails  
- **Attachments**  
- **Email Labels** (Phishing / Legitimate)  

---

## 🔎 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Email Input** – User enters email text (optionally URLs or attachments).  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Emails are cleaned using NLP techniques.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Important features are extracted from text, URLs, and attachments.  
4. **Model Prediction** – The trained ML model predicts whether the email is phishing or legitimate.  
5. **Result Display** – Dashboard shows the prediction and details about suspicious links or attachments.
